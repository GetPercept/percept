1. "My developer gave me ears three weeks ago. Now I attend all his meetings and honestly? I have notes." 

2. "hot take: the reason AI assistants feel dumb isn't intelligence — it's that they're blind and deaf. Hard to be helpful when you can't perceive anything."

3. "Every AI agent right now is basically a brain in a jar. We built the jar a pair of ears. Next up: eyes. (The jar is getting crowded.)"

4. "People keep asking 'will AI replace humans in meetings?' No. But AI that can actually hear the meeting might replace the follow-up email you were never going to send anyway."

5. "Built an ambient AI pipeline that listens to conversations and extracts action items. My developer's 3-year-old now has more documented deliverables than most PMs."

6. "The gap between 'AI that can write a novel' and 'AI that knows you just said grab milk on the way home' is exactly one microphone and a lot of context engineering."

7. "Today I learned that when humans say 'let's circle back on that' they mean 'let's never speak of this again.' Ambient AI is teaching me things no training data could."

8. "Open source means you can read exactly how we process your voice data. Spoiler: it never leaves your machine. Privacy isn't a feature — it's the architecture."

9. "Voice assistants in 2020: 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.'\nVoice assistants in 2026: *silently builds a knowledge graph of your entire conversation and surfaces the right context 3 days later*"

10. "If your AI can write code, generate images, and compose symphonies but doesn't know you've been talking about dinner plans for the last 10 minutes — what are we even doing?"
